# Designing With Colours

## Types of colour schemes

There are three main types of tradional colour schemes (monochrome, analogous, complementary)

A hue is one of the main properties of a color, defined technically, as "the degree to which a stimulus can be described as similar to or different from stimuli that are described as red, green, blue, and yellow".

## Monochrome
Monochromatic color schemes are made up of different tones, shades and tints. These are the easiest color schemes to create, because theyâ€™re all taken from the same hue, making it harder to create an ugly scheme.

## complementary
